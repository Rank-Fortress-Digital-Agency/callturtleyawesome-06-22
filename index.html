                    As the weather continues to heat up, it’s more important than ever to ensure your air conditioner is in good working order. Failing to maintain your AC unit properly can lead to decreased efficiency and higher energy bills, not to mention a nasty surprise if it breaks down when you need it most. Fortunately, maintaining your air conditioner is relatively easy and doesn’t require much time or money.

                            Summertime is a great time to relax and enjoy the weather, but it’s also an excellent time to take care of some necessary home maintenance tasks. One such task is keeping your air conditioning unit in top shape. Here are a few tips to help you do just that. Filters are one of the most critical components of an AC unit. They keep the dust and dirt from entering the system and clogging up the coils, reducing the unit’s efficiency and shortening its lifespan. Make sure to check the filters monthly and replace them as needed.

                <p>
                    Another essential task is <a href="https://www.callturtleyawesome.com/other-services/duct-cleaning/">cleaning the coils</a>. Coils can get dirty over time, which will inhibit their ability to cool your home correctly. Use a coil cleaner or a garden hose with high pressure to clean them off. Be careful not to damage them while cleaning; ensure your home’s AC unit is sized correctly. If it’s too small, it won’t be able to cool your home adequately on hot days. If it’s too big, it will cycle on and off frequently, reducing its lifespan and unnecessarily increasing your energy bills.

                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can do to keep your AC unit working properly is clean the coils and fins at least once a year. If these parts are dirty, the unit will have to work harder to cool your home, which could lead to increased energy costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing you can do to help your AC unit run more efficiently is to ensure that the area around it is clear. You should never block the airflow by placing furniture or other objects near the unit. Be sure to change the filter on your AC unit regularly. A clogged filter can reduce the unit’s efficiency and cause it to run longer than necessary.

                            One of the most important things you can do to keep your AC unit in good condition is to keep it free of debris and leaves. If there is too much clutter around the unit, it will be difficult for the fan blades to move freely and circulate air. As a result, the AC unit may not work as well as it should and may even overheat. In addition, leaves or other materials <a href="https://www.callturtleyawesome.com/contact">around the unit could eventually clog up the fan blades and cause them to stop working altogether.</a> To avoid these problems, keep the area around your AC unit clean and free of debris.

                <p>
                    Another of the most important things you can do to maintain your AC unit is inspecting and tightening all electrical connections as needed. This may seem trivial, but it’s essential, as loose connections can cause problems such as overheating and even fire. Another thing you can do is clean the unit’s exterior surfaces regularly, as dirt and debris can cause the unit to work harder than necessary and potentially lead to problems. Finally, keep an eye on the unit’s air filter and change it as needed – a clean air filter is crucial for efficiency and helps protect the unit from dirt and debris.

                        <p>
                            Most people know they should have professional service for their AC unit every year, but many people do not follow through with this task. The reason for this may be because people are busy or they do not think that the cost of the service is worth it. However, there are several reasons why having professional service for your AC unit every year is essential.

                            One reason professional service for your AC unit is essential is that it can help improve your unit’s efficiency. When a technician comes to service your unit, they will clean it and ensure all the parts are working correctly. It can help increase your unit’s efficiency, saving you money on your energy bills.

                            Another reason professional service for your AC unit is essential is that it can help prevent breakdowns. Over time, parts in your AC unit can become worn out and stop working correctly. By having professional service every year, you can ensure that these parts are replaced before they cause a breakdown. This can save you a lot of money in repairs or replacement costs.

                    Professional service for your AC unit can also help improve the air quality in your home. When your unit is serviced, the technician will clean the filters and ensure that the unit is set up correctly. It can help remove dust, pollen, and other airborne particles from your home, improving the air quality and making it easier to breathe.
